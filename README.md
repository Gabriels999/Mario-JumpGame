# Mario-JumpGame
A Mario jump game like flappy bird but this time our hero only need to jump the pipes coming from bellow.

### Hello there! 👋👋 This is a game flappy bird style but with our favourite italian plummer from Nintendo franchises.
### This game was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is pretty simple but my goal with that was to practice the animation concept from CSS. I found the project a very fun ideia from the "Manual do Dev" channel on youtube.
### My ideia is to take the project presented on the video and slowly add some new features to make the game even more fun.
#### Anyways, hope u guys like!
